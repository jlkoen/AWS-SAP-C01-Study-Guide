## My Question Analysis Technique

** Understand **  
- Determine the key question - the "kicker"  
- Figure out what everything means - question and response  

** Eliminate **  
- Get rid of responses that are fake or have errors  
- Get rid of responses that conflict with the question  

** Evaluate **  
- Think through tradeoffs for remaining responses  
- Consider both stated and implied dimensions  

** Choose **  
- Pick the right answer  
- Select best options or eliminate the bad ones  

** Validate **  
- Make sure the response *answers* the key question  
- Make sure the response doesn't conflict with any details
